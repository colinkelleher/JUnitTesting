Java JUnitTesting


A bash script called tester, which should carry out
some unit tests using the JUnit framework. The unit tests themselves should be implemented
in a single source file called Tester.java.
The unit tests should be for a simple Car class. The main purpose of the Car class is to
represent a car which can move, stop, change its direction and change its speed. The operations
of the Car are not time-critical, so we don’t need to test the efficiency of the operations.

Two tests for each of the following instance methods:
◦ stop( );
◦ move( );
◦ isMoving( );
◦ isAtOriginalPosition( );
◦ incrementSpeedInHorizontalDirection( );
◦ decrementSpeedInHorizontalDirection( );
◦ incrementSpeedInVerticalDirection( );
◦ decrementSpeedInVerticalDirection( );
